## CDC Data Display
Created an interactive display which showcases 9 different correlated relationships between smoking, physical activity, and median househod income and three health indicators. Website is hosted through Github Pages: https://ashok-bidani.github.io/CDC-Data-Display/.

## Variables
The data in this project is distributed across 51 circles, each of which represents the statistic for a particular state (or the DC area). The three X variables are shown below the X axis and are health impactors. Each of these has a substantial correlation with the three health indicators shown to the left of the Y axis (these three health indicators are the Y variables). Clicking on an axis label will change the axis and the graph to reflect the new data.

The three X variables are:

- Smoking (percentage of state population that are current smokers)

- Physical Activity Last Month (percentage of state population that exercised at least once in the previous month)

- Median Household Income (median household income for the state, in dollars).

The three Y variables are:

- Depression (percentage of state population who has ever been told they have a form of depression)

- Heart Attack Ever (percentage of state population who has ever been told they have had a heart attack)

- Diabetes Ever (percentage of state population who has ever been told they have diabetes).

The default relationship is set to Smoking (%) versus Heart Attack Ever (%).

## Demo
Here is a video of myself demonstrating use of the display (I show 6 relationships of the possible 9).
